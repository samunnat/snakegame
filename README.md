# Snake Game

Where it all began... This was my final project for the Intro to Programming course I took in junior year of high school (2015). It's written in the Racket programming language, which is based on a minimalist dialect of Lisp. Racket was incredibly fun to learn.

## How to Play
If for some reason you want to run this glorious masterpiece, you'll need to:
1. [Download Racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/)
2. Open snake_game.rkt in the DrRacket IDE.
3. Click Run.
